<h2>Why is This Needed?</h2>
<p>
In recent years, voter confidence in the fairness and impartiality of elections has significantly declined.
This lack of trust stems from several issues, including the potential for conflicts of interest when government officials oversee elections in which they themselves are candidates.
</p>
<p>
Ideally, elections would be conducted by the community rather than by the officials who have a vested interest in the outcome. This concept is often referred to as <strong>Community Managed Elections (CME)</strong>.
However, organizing such community-led elections presents its own challenges, as communities often rely on government structures for coordination.
This dependency creates a barrier to achieving truly independent and transparent elections.
</p>
<p>
VoteTorrent seeks to address these issues by providing a platform that enables communities to achieve CME without heavy reliance on government authorities.
