<h1>How VoteTorrent Solves Voting Issues</h1>

<div class="info-box">
<p>VoteTorrent leverages modern peer-to-peer networking and cryptographic technology to create a voting system that is secure, transparent, and community-driven. The key features of VoteTorrent include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Peer-to-Peer Coordination:</strong> Elections are largely coordinated by the community through a decentralized network, reducing the need for government involvement.</li>
    <li><strong>Cryptographic Security:</strong> Votes are encrypted and anonymized, ensuring that each vote is secure and private while still being verifiable by the voter.</li>
    <li><strong>Transparent Verification:</strong> Each voter can verify that their vote has been accurately counted without revealing how they voted. The system ensures that everyone can see who voted, but not how they voted.</li>
    <li><strong>Efficient Runoff Elections:</strong> The platform supports electronic runoff elections, ensuring that the winning candidate always receives more than 50% of the vote.</li>
</ul>
<p>By addressing the weaknesses of current voting methods, VoteTorrent offers a more reliable and trustworthy way to conduct elections, fostering greater voter confidence and participation.</p>
