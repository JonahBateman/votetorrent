<h2>How VoteTorrent Solves Voting Issues</h2>
<p>VoteTorrent is built on the principle of <strong>Community Managed Elections (CME)</strong>, where the community itself, rather than centralized government bodies, manages the core mechanics of voting, ballot handling, and vote counting. This approach enhances transparency and trust. VoteTorrent implements CME through a novel <strong>Distributed Election Network (DEN)</strong>.</p>
<p>The key features of VoteTorrent include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Distributed Election Network (DEN):</strong> Elections are coordinated by the community through a decentralized network primarily composed of users' private devices (like smartphones). This DEN handles registration, voting, validation, and storage, significantly reducing reliance on government infrastructure for these critical tasks.</li>
    <li><strong>Cryptographic Security:</strong> Votes are encrypted and anonymized, ensuring that each vote is secure and private while still being verifiable by the voter.</li>
    <li><strong>Transparent Verification:</strong> Each voter can verify that their vote has been accurately counted without revealing how they voted. The system ensures that everyone can see who voted, but not how they voted.</li>
    <li><strong>Efficient Runoff Elections:</strong> The platform facilitates the use of runoff elections, ensuring that the winning candidate always receives more than 50% of the vote.</li>
</ul>
<p>By addressing the weaknesses of current voting methods, VoteTorrent offers a more reliable and trustworthy way to conduct elections, fostering greater voter confidence and participation.</p>
