<h2>Benefits of Using VoteTorrent</h2>
<p>VoteTorrent offers numerous benefits over traditional voting methods, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Cost Savings:</strong> Utilizing a <strong>Distributed Election Network (DEN)</strong> primarily composed of user devices significantly reduces the infrastructure and personnel costs associated with setting up and managing physical polling places and centralized systems.</li>
    <li><strong>Manpower Efficiency:</strong> The DEN automates many tasks traditionally performed by volunteers or paid staff, streamlining the election process and reducing the burden on communities.</li>
    <li><strong>Vote Verification:</strong> Each voter can independently verify that their vote has been accurately counted, increasing transparency and trust in the election process.</li>
    <li><strong>Fraud Prevention:</strong> The use of cryptographic technology and decentralized coordination greatly reduces the potential for fraud and manipulation in elections.</li>
    <li><strong>Voter Privacy:</strong> VoteTorrent ensures voter privacy by anonymizing votes, allowing voters to participate without fear of their choices being revealed.</li>
</ul>
