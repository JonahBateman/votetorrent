I'm developing open source software called votetorrent that allows groups
of people to vote in any kind of poll and/or election.

An introduction to the system is found here:
  https://github.com/gotchoices/votetorrent/blob/master/README.md

and an addition FAQ is here:
  https://github.com/gotchoices/votetorrent/blob/master/doc/user-faq.md

I'd like to write an article based on the bullet points below.  The purpose
of the article is to convince the reader that:
- such a system is needed; and
- this particular implementation can be trusted

Idea points (in no particular organizational order):
- Voters have low confidence that elections are fair and impartial
- It seems a bit of a conflict of interest for government officials to
  conduct an election fairly if it might result in them losing.
- Ideally elections would be conducted by the community rather than the
  governnment officials who themselves are running for re-election.
- But it is difficult to have the community conduct an election because
  they are usually not organized except by way of their government.
- When more than two candidates run in an election, a winner might
  be elected with only a plurality.  In this case, a runoff election
  would be ideal but is rarely practical.  If elections could be
  conducted electronically where each voter participates by using their
  mobile phone, runoff elections would now be feasible.
- Runoff elections are preferrable because the winner will always be
  elected with more than 50% of the vote.
- It is difficult for people to trust in-person voting because their
  ballot just goes into a box and they have no way to verify that it
  has actually been counted correctly.
- Current mail-in voting is subject to fraud since anyone can fill
  out a ballot and send it in.
- With either in-person or mail-in voting, the voter has no way to
  verify that his vote has been counted.
- With mail-in voting, one's vote is not truly secret since those
  opening the ballots can see who sent in each ballot.
- Current peer-to-peer networking and cryptograph technology enables
  us to conduct a vote largely coordinated by the community.  This
  is the purpose of votetorrent.
- The government (the authority) needs only to publish the parameters
  of the election and certify the results.  
- Each voter can verify that their vote has been properly counted.
- Everyone can see who voted, but not how they voted.
- Much of the potential for fraud or incompetence on the part of
  those conducting the election is removed.
- Votetorrent saves huge amounts of money in comparison to past and
  current methods.
- Votetorrent saves huge amounts of volunteer manpower compared to
  past and current methods.
